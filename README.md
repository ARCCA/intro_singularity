[![Create a Slack Account with ddus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Create_Slack_Account-The_Carpentries-071159.svg)](https://swc-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/)

This repository generates the corresponding lesson website from [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) repertoire of lessons. 

The material is based from the very good sessions delivered from [ARCHER](ImperialCollegeLondon/2020-07-13-Containers-Online).  This focuses just on Singularity so shorter and introduces building code on remote services.

This is not a Software Carpentry lesson but we use the template from Software Carpentry since it is so suitable for
online training.
